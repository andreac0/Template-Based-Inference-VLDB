# Template-Based-Inference-VLDB

This repository includes the KG applications, the domain glossaries and some explanatory sample data that demonstrate the implementation of the approach presented in the paper **Template-based Explaniable Inference in High-stakes Financial Knowledge Graphs** submitted to VLDB 2024 - Industrial Track.

## Domain Glossary
The folder Domain_Glossary contains the predicate description for the KG applications we demonstrate. They derive from internal definitions stored in the data dictionary.

## Knowledge Graph Applications
The folder Knowledge_Graph_Applications contains the dependency graphs of the presented application in the form of json files. They also include some explanatory small chase graphs that can be used to test the implementation

## Template Explanation Notebook
The notebook in this repo is a working example that applies our approach to the KG applications
